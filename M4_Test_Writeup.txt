    testEnemyLocationSetter():
         This method tests whether setting an enemy's location updates properly. It does this by instantiating an example enemy (enemy1) and calling it's 
         setter methods accordingly.

    testEnemyHealth():
        This method tests whether damaging an enemy works. It takes Enemy2 as an example which has a health of 20 and applies a damage of 10 on the enemy.

    testDamageToMonument():
        This method tests if the enemy damages the monument when it has certain health, the health for enemy should change accordingly. This can be used
        when we don't have specific health as well.

    testRestartButton():
        This method tests if enemy damage leads to restart screen. If so, it should also result in game start screen with the flag of true.
