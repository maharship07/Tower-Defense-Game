Manu Gupta:
    upgradeDamageTest():
        This test checks whether upgrading a tower increases the damage as expected. Because towers should only be able to be upgraded once, this test
        also checks what happens when an upgrade is attempted on a tower twice.

    upgradeRangeTest()
       This test checks whether using the range upgrade will double the range as expected. Since towers can only be upgraded once, this test also verifies
       that the tower doesn't upgrade its range again after its been doubled once already.

Vedant Amin:

    bossDamageMonument():
        This tests checks if the final boss can attack the monument and whether the monument takes damages or not and after attacking
        if the health decreases to zero.
