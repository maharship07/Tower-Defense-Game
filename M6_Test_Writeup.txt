    upgradeDamageTest():
        This test checks whether upgrading a tower increases the damage as expected. Because towers should only be able to be upgraded once, this test
        also checks what happens when an upgrade is attempted on a tower twice.

    upgradeRangeTest()
       This test checks whetheer using the range upgrade will double the range as expected. Since towers can only be upgraded once, this test also verifies
       that the tower doesn't upgrade its range again after its been doubled once already.
